    Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript portion of web
    site production as opposed to the database on server-side programming. It
    encompasses everything from building a simple page of HTML text to creating
    complex, responsive HTML5 websites designed to be accessed via various
    different browsers, devices and screen sizes.
